The arduino library should be compiled into an archive library .a and integrated during Contiki OS compilation.

1) Compile the arduino program by a traditionnal way
2) Get ALL object files, including ones of the libraries execpted the main.cpp.o because we will use one of Contiki
3) If some implemented functions in Arduino should be in Contiki, their prototype should be declared in extern "C" {} section of Arduino.h
4) Build the archive avr-ar -cvq dvs_arduino.a *.o
5) Move the archive libs folder to be included in Contiki compilation process thanks to Makefile.dvs

!! Trouble, some conflicts can occur about timers and other hardware component between Contiki and Arduino.
